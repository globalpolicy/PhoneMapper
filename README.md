# PhoneMapper
A simple app that lets you visualize where you've been
<br/>
<p>
Basic setup requires a direct download URL to a log file containing your device records(locations, battery levels, etc) which it displays on a map.
You are responsible for maintaining the log file and keeping it updated. The recommended way is to make a MacroDroid macro that runs every hour and logs the device locations, etc
to a local file on your phone. You can then either manually make periodic uploads of this file to a cloud storage service (such as Google Drive) or use an app such as DriveSync
to do the uploading automatically for you.
